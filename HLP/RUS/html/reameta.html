<P>A regular expression is a pattern that is matched against a subject string from left to right. Most characters stand for themselves in a pattern, and match the corresponding characters in the subject. As a trivial example, the pattern</P>

<P>The quick brown fox</P>

<P>matches a portion of a subject string that is identical to itself. The power of regular expressions comes from the ability to include alternatives and repetitions in the pattern. These are encoded in the pattern by the use of <B>meta-characters</B>, which do not stand for themselves but instead are interpreted in some special way.</P>

<P>There are two different sets of meta-characters: those that are recognised anywhere in the pattern except within square brackets, and those that are recognised in square brackets. Outside square brackets, the meta-characters are as follows:</P>

<TABLE cols=2 width=335>

<P>Part of a pattern that is in square brackets is called a "character class". In a character class the only meta-characters are:</P>

<TABLE cols=2 width=318>
