<H1><A NAME="idh_cfgpasswords"></A>Password Configuration</H1>

<P>Passwords of file transfer session are defined in the Password Configuration <A HREF="guigrid.html">string grid</A>. It is possible to define one password for several nodes (the node addresses should be divided with a space). Note that <A HREF="addrmasks.html">address masks</A> and <A HREF="regexp.html">Regular Expressions</A> are not allowed.</P>

<P>If using <A HREF="crammd5.html">CRAM-MD5</A>, passwords are case-sensitive, in other cases passwords are not case-sensitive.</P>

<P>If the mailer got an incoming connection with a system that has no password defined in the Password configuration, the session is non-password-protected. All the files and mail packets received during such a session are placed in <A HREF="sdii.html">Insecure Inbound</A>. However, if the remote system sends a password in the session handshake packet, Argus adds “<CODE>Remote proposes password....</CODE>” record to the log file.</P>

<P>If a calling system sends a password other than that configured for one or more of its addresses, the session is terminated with a log record “<CODE>Remote presented .... when .... required</CODE>” (or “<CODE>Remote presented no password when .... required</CODE>”). Before the termination, Argus sends handshake packet with “<CODE>BAD_PASSWORD</CODE>” (or “<CODE>NO_PASSWORD</CODE>”) keyword instead of the real password to let the remote system  know the reason for failure. After that, “<CODE>Password security violation - disconnecting</CODE>” is added to the log and the caller is disconnected.</P>

<P>If passwords match, the session is password-protected and all the received files will be placed in <A HREF="sdsi.html">Secure Inbound</A>, “<CODE>Password-protected session</CODE>” record is added to the log.</P>

<P>You may also define passwords via <A HREF="atoms.html">Password atom</A>. </P>

<P>When Argus needs a password for particular node, it first looks for Password atom, then seeks in the list loaded from auxiliary passwords file and then in the grid.</P>

<H2>Auxiliary Passwords File</H2>

<P>You may specify here a file that defines additional passwords besides of listed in the string grid. The format of the file follows, one password per line:</P>

<PRE><CODE>AddressList | Password</CODE></PRE>

<P>Example:</P>

<PRE><CODE>2:469/38 | SUPER
2:469/77 2:469/84 | PUPER</CODE></PRE>

<P>Auxiliary passwords file is loading into memory on Argus Start-up and by detection of <CODE>PASSWORD.OK</CODE> <A HREF="fileflags.html">file-flag</A> in Argus <A HREF="hd.html">Home Directory</A>. Results of parsing of the file are logged in polls log.</P>
