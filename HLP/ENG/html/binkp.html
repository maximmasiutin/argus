<P><A NAME="idh_binkp"></A><SUP></SUP>BinkP is a new transfer protocol designed especially for using IP connections for FTN developed in 1996 by Dima Maloff. This protocol does not imitate a Dial-up connection, so it allows to use maximum performance because the absence of irrelevant data transferred within Dial-up connections (such as checksums for example) and using of two-way data flow. The default IP port number for BinkP is 24554. BinkP could be used over Dial-up as well. In that case Niagara algorithms would be used on Transport Layer. BinkP allows <A HREF="binkpenc.html">flow encryption</A> and <A HREF="crammd5.html">CRAM-MD5</A>.</P>
