<p>Argus  Copyright &copy; 1996-2000 RITLABS S.R.L.</p>
<p>Written by Maxim Masiutin</p>
<p>This copyright applies to all source code, compiled code, help files, documentation, graphics and auxiliary files, except those parts written by other people (which are normally copyright their authors). The licence applies to the whole program. This licence describes the conditions under which you may use, modify, run and distribute Argus. Except where stated, the conditions of this licence apply equally to the source code for Argus, as well as to any compiled version. "Work based on Argus" and / or "Products derived from Argus" mean any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing Argus (in source or other form) or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. If you are unable or unwilling to accept these conditions in full, then, notwithstanding the conditions in the remainder of this licence, you may not use, modify or distribute Argus at all.</p> 
<ol>
<li><p>Any use of Argus which is illegal under international or local law is forbidden by this licence. Any such action is the sole responsibility of the person committing the action.</p>
<li><p>Argus is free for non-commercial use. Commercial users of Argus must pay registration fee to RITLABS.</p>
<li><p>You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of Argus' source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this Licence and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of Argus a copy of this Licence along with Argus.</p> 
<p>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy.</p> 
<li><p>You may modify your copy or copies of Argus or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on Argus, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 3 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</p> 
<ol>
<li>You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change. 
<li>You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from Argus or any part thereof, to be licenced as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this Licence. 
<li>You are acknowledging that RITLABS may include your modifications into Argus.<br><br>
</ol>
<li><p>Products derived from Argus may not be called "Argus" nor may "Argus" appear in their names. All advertising materials mentioning features or use of this software, as well as message at program startup or in documentation (on-line or textual) must display the following acknowledgement: "Based on Argus by RITLABS S.R.L. (http://www.ritlabs.com/argus/)"</p> 
<li><p>You may copy and distribute Argus (or a work based on it, under Section 4) in object, binary or executable form under the terms of Sections 3 and 4 above provided that you also do one of the following:</p> 
<ol>
<li>Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 3 and 4 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, 
<li>Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, free of charge, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 3 and 4 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.<br><br>
</ol>
<li><p>You may not copy, modify, sublicence, or distribute Argus except as expressly provided under this Licence. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicence or distribute Argus is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this Licence. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this Licence will not have their licences terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.</p> 
<li><p>Each time you redistribute Argus (or any work based on Argus), the recipient automatically receives a licence from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify Argus subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this Licence.</p> 
<li><p>NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND IS EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED. YOU USE ARGUS AT YOUR OWN RISK. RITLABS DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
