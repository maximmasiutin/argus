
    Argus - History


3.210 (26-Mar-2001)
-------------------

[+] Atom "Script" allows sending particular strings (commands)
    to remote interactively (e.g Login/Password to a router) before
    session starts.

    Works on outgoing sessions only, if a node number which is being 
    polled matches the specified list. The list allows masks.

    This scripts is a list of lines which are being sequentially sent
    to the remote. Before sending the string from the next line, Argus 
    waits for a  particular response came from the remote (or timeout).

    Each line is split on four strings:

    Modem Cmd, RegExp, T-out Sec, T-out Cmd.

    The Script is being activated immediately on Carrier Detect, each line
    will be handled according to the following scheme:

    -----------------------------------------------------------------
    START OF LINE: The command "Modem Cmd" is being sent to the modem. 
    Please note that "!", "|", "~" and other special characters are 
    handled. After sending the "Modem Cmd", the script goes to "SCAN".

    SCAN: Argus scans the input stream coming from the modem whether it 
    matches the regular expression "RegExp" and simultaneously checks for 
    the time-out "T-out Sec" to expire. 

    If the "RegExp" matches, the script continues with the next line of
    the script ("T-out Cmd" will not be sent), i.e. it goes to "START OF 
    LINE".

    If the time-out "T-out Sec" expires, the "T-out Cmd" command is being 
    sent to the modem, and the script remains on the same line, continuing
    with "SCAN". If the "T-out Cmd" is empty (not specified), the script 
    goes to the previous line (or remains on the same, if it was on the 
    first line), see "START OF LINE".
    -----------------------------------------------------------------

    There is however a global handshake timeout, which limits the maximum
    allowed handshake time. Upon the expiration of this time-out, Argus
    hangs up the modem. This global timeout also applies to the script.


[*] Version 3.3 of the PCRE library is used (Perl-Compatible Regular 
    Expressions). Regular expression support is provided by the PCRE 
    library package, which is open source software, written by Philip 
    Hazel, and copyright by the University of Cambridge, England.

[+] It is possible to avoid re-starts of Argus on fatal WinSock errors
    (shutdown/closesocket errors). The use of this feature isn't 
    recommended because of normal work after a fatal error is almost
    impossible.

    [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\RIT\ARGUS\CurrentVersion\IniFile.ini]
    "DisableWinsockTraps"=dword:00000001

[+] It is possible to choose which WinSocket version to use:

    [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\RIT\ARGUS\CurrentVersion\IniFile.ini]

    "WinSockVersion"=dword:00000001
    for WinSocket v1

    "WinSockVersion"=dword:00000002
    for WinSocket v2

    "WinSockVersion"=dword:00000000 (and other values grater than 2)
    to automatically choose WinSocket version (by default).

3.208 (7-Apr-2000)

[+] current.ip file-flag indicates that at least one TCP/IP connection 
    is currently opened.

[+] An ability to save partially received fax pages (Oleg Vasenyoff).

    To turn this option on, add the following registry value:

    Sorokin).

[-] Outbound Manager scanner could ignore .bsy-files when opening .?lo-files
    (Dmitry Toporkov).

[-] Fixed trap when polling a node from line that just restored a serial port
    during "Accept No Incoming" atom (Oleg Redut).



3.193 (03-Oct-1999)
-------------------

[+] Argus now handles Pvt/Hold/Down flags of nodelist.

[-] Fixed bug (of 3.192) in pop-up menus of string grids.

[+] An ability to ignore Log-Off signals (WM_ENDSESSION and 
    WM_QUERYENDSESSION). his may be useful when running as NT service.

    To turn this option on, add the following registry value:

    [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\RIT\ARGUS\CurrentVersion\IniFile.ini]
    "IgnoreEndSession"=dword:00000001

[*] Updated help file.



3.192 (11-Sep-1999)
-------------------

[-] Passing socket handles to External Applications under Win95/98
    could not work (Notanee Bourassa). Now, to run eleBBS in telnet
    mode, use the following data in Config/External/Doors/
    Door and parameters: c:\ele\elebbs.exe -XC -XT -B%B -H%h -N%n

[-] Stand-off timer could not work properly.

[-] Some fixes with Russian translation.

[-] Fixed log lines order of Response Log Format atom (Ed Vedernikoff).

[-] Fixed %Z handling when running a DOS Session (Mike Ehlert).

[-] Fixed "xBaseDone while ThreadCount=..." message.

[+] ODBC logging. To turn it on, create in "ODBC Data Source Administrator"
    a data source named "ArgusLog". In the database, create a table named
    LogStrings with the following mandatory columns: three text columns
    called "Logger", "RecTag", and "RecMsg" and a timestamp column "RecTime".
    You may also add additional 'row number' fields, but make sure they
    are automatically updated, Argus would never there. Argus doesn't currently
    log other information to ODBC. To add log records, Argus executes the
    following SQL statement: 

  INSERT INTO LogStrings (Logger, RecTag, RecTime, RecMsg) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)

    You may issue the following SQL statement to create LogStrings table
    under Microsoft Access:

       create table LogStrings (
    	 RecId   counter NOT NULL CONSTRAINT RecIdIndex PRIMARY KEY,
  	 Logger  char(20) NOT NULL,
  	 RecTag  char(1) NOT NULL,
  	 RecTime date NOT NULL,
  	 RecMsg  char(250) NOT NULL);
  
    Then go to Config/Start-up, turn ODBC logging on and restart Argus.
    ODBC errors are looged to "odbcerr.log" file in Argus logs directory.
    

3.188 (3-Jul-1999)
------------------

[*] %ARCMAIL% now works in atoms (Alex Berez).

[-] On outgoing session, if remote indicates to receive file(s)
    later, a poll goes to stand-by mode (unless is manual).
    In previous versions of Argus the node was polled again
     without a delay.

[-] When resuming broken file transfers, secondary addresses
    of remote are also used to locate a file in temporary
    inbound (Dmitry Rahalov).

[-] Multiple instances of "file not sent - reason is ..." are fixed.

[-] If there was a post-processor external application for a defined
    node, it wasn't launched after a session with this node if no
    files has been received (Alexey V Bugrov).

[*] Support of FSC-0056 link options (HAT, etc...)

[-] Idle time after modem initialisation increased from 2 to 5 secs.

[-] Changes in Node Inspector didn't take effect until reloading Argus.

[-] Fax inbound directory hasn't been created automatically 
    (Vladimir Januszkiewicz).

[-] Change status reversed order of attached files (Alexander Savich).

[-] Event linking/unlinking to a line or TCP/IP Daemon didn't take effect 
    until reload a line or TCP/IP Daemon.

[+] Info command (see Modem General Commands string grid) is sent
    to the modem after a session termination. The result of this command
    is logged. You may use Response Log Format atom to format data came 
    from a modem.

[+] New WatchDog atoms:
       Input WatchDog Reset
         Resets the line.
       Input WatchDog ExtApp
         Executes specified External Application.
       Accept Nodes Only Listed
         Accept calls Only from addresses Listed in nodelist or
         Argus passwords or overrides.

[+] New formatting atoms:
       Input Log Format
       Response Log Format

    Input Log Format atom scans data came from modem, and if it
    matches regular expression, formats the data and logs.

    Response Log Format atom works the same way as Input Log Format atom
    except it does only scan data came from modem after Answer or Info 
    commands.
   
    Examples for ZyXEL U1496 E+ 
    (taken from Bink/+ Config File by Vsevolod Fedotov)

       Accept Nodes Only Listed
         Accept calls Only from addresses Listed in nodelist or
         Argus passwords or overrides.
       Accept BPS Efficiency Min
       Transmit BPS Efficiency Min

[*] Fixed "Times (run/user/kernel) = 11/0/0 sec." log message. As you've
    noticed, it always returned 0/0 as a user/kernel time, even if the amount
    of spent times was more than a second. Now the time is logged in 
    milliseconds.

[*] "close.linename" & "open.linename" flags are deleted only in case of
    successful open / close operation. E.g. open.line1 flag will not be
    deleted until the line actually opens with a valid serial port.

[+] Perl-Compatible Regular Expressions, thanks to Philip Hazel.
    Regular Expressions may be used in file masks, address masks,
    Modem Responses and File-Box configuration, i.e. anywhere where
    generic masks are allowed (though Modem Responses do not allow
    generic masks :-))

    Some info on Regular Expression syntax can be found at

    http://www.activestate.com/ActivePerl/docs/lib/pod/perlre.html#Regular_Expressions

    To insert a Regular Expression, use '~' character as a marker. 
    Next character (following '~' marker) will be used as a delimiter 
    to define the end of Regular Expression. Any text after
    '~' between delimiting characters will be treated as a 
    Regular Expression.

    syntax is

    before~#regularexpression#after

    where "before" and "after" is optional text that will be matched
    as a generic mask (a character matches itself, '?' matches any 
    character, '*' matches a sequence of characters).
    
    "regularexpression" is a text of a Regular Expression.
    
    '#' - delimiter character.

    E.g. a file mask

    ~#cat(aract|erpillar|)\..*#

    will match a file named "cat", "cataract", or "caterpillar", with any 
    extension.

    the above example is equivalent to 

    ~#cat(aract|erpillar|)#.*

    here the text after delimiter (".*") is treated as a generic mask, i.e. '.' 
    matches a dot character and '*' matches sequence of characters.

    Note that you don't need to anchor your regular expressions (using '^' 
    and '$') in file masks - they would be anchored automatically, and if you 
    need to skip some characters before of after, use ".*" :-)

    Here is another example of using regular expressions in Modem Responses:

    ~#^RING(\x20\d)?$#

    Because of space (or other) character may be used as a separator in Argus 
    Configuration String Grids, such character should should not occur inside a regular expression. 
    This is because of separator characters in a string grid (e.g. space) have greater priority than a regular 
    expression delimiters (e.g. '#').

    To avoid using string grid separator character in a Regular Expression, use hex codes
    (e.g. \x20 for space character) or corresponding patterns (e.g. \s , that will match any whitespace character). 

    If you plan using '#' character within a regular expression, you may also
    use it's hex code, but better way would be choosing another delimiter :-)

    ~`^RING(\x20#\d)?$`

    To insert ~ character into a generic mask, double it to avoid using it as a
    regular expression marker.

[+] An ability to open .BSY-files without DELETE_ON_CLOSE mode. Files will 
    be deleting using DeleteFile command. This may be useful on some
    network file system which don't support DELETE_ON_CLOSE mode.

    To turn this option on, add the following registry value:

    [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\RIT\ARGUS\CurrentVersion\IniFile.ini]
    "SimpleBSY"=dword:00000001

    PASSWORD.LST hardcoded file name of 3.161 is obsolette.
   

3.181 (30-Dec-1998)
-------------------

[!] Config/File boxes. 
    Options|Root directory input line of this diallog allows to define a 
    root for all filebox directories listed in Nodes|Path. The rules of adding
    Root directory to filebox directory are the same as for Home Directory of 
    Config|Paths.

[-] Fixed a bug of 3.178-3.179 that cause 100% CPU load after modifying 
    events (Alexey V Bugrov).

[*] This version consumes almost twice less memory than 3.163-3.179.

[*] All strings (like CallerId), came from modem after answer before connect 
    are logged.

[+] Incoming fileboxes (Config/Externals/PostProcessors), also allow all
    listed above macros except of %STATUS and %TSTATUS.

[+] "^" prefix in incoming filebox means that the newly received files
    should overwrite existing instead of queuing in INTMP.

    Example: Config/Externals/Postprocessors:

    Mask List   String to execute

[-] Connect string was not logged before "Connection too slow - 
    disconnecting" (Serge Dobronravov).

[+] It is possible to use custom values for access_log, agent_log and 
    binary_log files names to avoid troubles on 8.3 file 
    systems (Barry Blackford).

    To change them, create a registry key
    
    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\RIT\ARGUS\CurrentVersion\IniFile.ini

    Names of String Values:

    access_log

    file from the list of files matching the WildCard to be transferred by 
    request (Oleg Vasenyoff).

    Alias NODEDIFF gives the lastes node-diff:

    Alias      Path

    NODEDIFF   >R:\AF\NODELIST\NODEDIFF.Z%%


[+] PASSWORD.LST in Argus Home Directory adds additional passwords besides of
    listed in Config/Passwords grig. The format of PASSWORD.LST is the 
    following, one password per line:
    
    AddressList|Password

    Example:

    2:469/38|SUPER
    2:469/77 2:469/84|PUPER

    PASSWORD.LST is loading into memory on Argus Start-up and by detection of
    PASSWORD.OK	file-flag.

[!] Possibility to close and open lines automatically by using file-flags,
    located in home directory; "close.linename" & "open.linename" for
    modem lines and close.ip & open.ip for TCP/IP daemon. E.g. if the line 
    calls "Line4", the flags should be named "close.Line4" and "open.Line4".

[+] Atoms: Accept Niagara Disabled

[-] Non-TCP/IP version were linked incorrectly.

[*] Removed threads.txt 


3.14 (7-Jan-1998)
-------------------

*** This is mostly a bug-fixing release, but some of very useful things
    were introduced though. Please, read the items below carefully.

[!] Fax reception in TIFF-format files instead of raw T.4 (Fyodor Ustinov,
    Jury Fradkin).

[+] Automatic fax bit order recognition.

[+] It is possible to launch an external application (or set a file-flag)
    to handle a received TIFF fax document (Fyodor Ustinov).

    Prefixes are the same as in Externals/Post-processors: 

     '<' - Run with Idle priority
     '+' - Run with High priority (dangerous)
     '*' - Run with Real-time priority (very dangerous)
     '?' - Run in detached mode (applicable for consoled Win32-apps. only)

     '>' - Do not launch application but create a file-flag instead.

    Use macros to obtain a file name of received TIFF fax document:

    %PATHNAME%  fully-qualified file name, e.g. d:\fl\infax\03Jan003.tif
    %PATH%      path to the file, e.g. d:\fl\infax\
    %NAME%      file name (without path and extension, e.g. 03Jan003
    %EXT%       file extension, e.g. .tif 

    Combination %PATH%%NAME%%EXT% is identical to %PATHNAME%


[*] Upgraded registration key. Visit
    https://www.cflash.com/ritlabs/argus_key_update.html
    to upgrade your existing Argus 2.xx key freely.

[+] Supports of connections via SOCKS4 proxy server 
    (Config/General/Use SOCKS proxy server).

[+] Atoms: Accept FReq Count Public
           Accept FReq Count Pwd-Prot
           Accept FReq Duration Public
           Accept FReq Duration Pwd-Prot
           Accept FReq Size Public
           Accept FReq Size Pwd-Prot
           Accept Nodes Only Pwd-Prot

           Transmit Files Forbidden 
           Transmit Files Required  
         Note: These two atoms do not affect on File Requests (.REQ) and 
              Crash-Flavoured attaches (.CLO/.CUT)

[+] "Permanent" checkbox in event configuration, used to define
    full-time-active events.

[+] Cron step values can be used in conjunction with ranges. Following a range
    with "/<number>" specifies skips of the number's value through the
    range. For example, "0-23/2" can be used in the hours field to specify
    command execution every other hour (the alternative of previous
    standard is "0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20,22"). Steps are also
    permitted after an asterisk, so if you want to say "every two hours",
    just use "*/2" (MaX Brashenko).

[*] DES/ECB changed to DES/CBC in encrypted session and encrypted config.
    DES/CBC is a bit better then DES/ECB, and can be used where medium
    level data security is needed.

[*] Incoming file requests are delaying when there already are pending
    requests, attached to .HRQ.

[+] You can also use <Delete> key in Outbound/Polls lists (Igor Garmiza).

[*] Manual poll counters are displayed properly (Vladimir Dobrachev).

[-] When remote proposes a password on non-password-sessions, the Password
    keyword is not writing to SRIF file. Also SystemStatus is now setting
    accordingly (Dmitry Kondratjev).

[*] Some fixes dedicated to correct modem initialisation. Also, port reloading
    may occur.

[*] Input buffer is now flushed before sending "|" control character in order
    to purge possible input characters and initialise modem properly (Sean
    Rima).

[-] Trailing and leading spaces in Nodelist/'Phones could cause troubles
    (Damien Sam).

[-] Message "Session with 1:153/950 when dialled 1:153/750 - disconnecting"
    didn't displayed on BinkP (Damien Sam).

[-] Fixed a memory leak, made in 3.134 (Fyodor Ustinov).

[*] Incoming traffic filtering, based on remote's address take place on
    password-protected sessions only (Oleg Vasenyoff).

[*] On Argus first-time setup, home directory by default is assigned to
    the same directory from which argus.exe was started, instead of \ARGUS
    (Oleg Vasenyoff).

[+] Possibility to delete all rows of a string grid at once, using pop-up menu
    or Ctrl+Shift+Y or Ctrl+Shift+Delete (Damien Sam).

[*] BinkP time-outs over Dial-up connection is 60 seconds. Was 360 like over
    TCP/IP.

[-] Mailer line number (%n handshake switch) is now 1-based (was zero-based),
    according to documentation (Sean Rima).

[-] It was unable to use handshake switches in path name, e.g.
    "c:\pb\node%n\proboard.exe" caused "The directory name is invalid"
    error (Sean Rima).

[-] External applications no more inherit Argus' handles, including serial
    ports and sockets handles.

[*] Argus process priority changed back to Normal from High.


3.134 (3-Dec-1997)
-------------------

[+] T-Mail / TheBrake! compatible refuse command reception on
    ZModem (Jury Fradkin).

[-] BinkleyTerm-compatible refuse command transmittion on 
    ZModem (Antonio Ianiri).

[-] Fixed problems with ifcico connectivity, I hope.

[-] GetFileInformationByHandle() Win32 API function is no more 
    used (Dimitri Tarassenko).

[-] Empty value of Password field of Config/Passwords dialogue
    is now being checked (Serj Li).

[-] Cosmetic fixes (Vladimir Bakhvaloff).

[-] Fixed improper DCE rate detection on some modems (Sean Rima).


3.132 (25-Nov-1997)
-------------------

[*] Four-digit date format.

[-] Fixed a start-up trap caused by config.bin missing.

[-] Fixed a bug with password-protected primary address calculation.



3.131 (19-Nov-1997)
-------------------

[!] Internal fax receiver.
    Intro
      Each mailer line now has a "Fax Inbound" fields. Received fax pages are
      placed there in T.4 Data format (defined in CCITT blue book volume VII
      T.4). Each modem has a "Fax" tab that defines whether internal or
      external Fax receiver is to be used.
    Modes
      Internal Fax receiver supports both fax services Class 2 and Class 2.0
      Please refer to your modem's manual to determine the fax class
      supported by your modem. Class 1 is not supported by internal fax
      receiver.
    Answer strings
      Answer strings are generally the same as for external fax receiver.
        For class 2 fax modems:
      ~AT&F|AT+FCLASS=2|AT+FLID="ID"|AT+FAA=1;a!
        For class 2.0 fax modems:
      ~AT&F|AT+FCLASS=2.0|AT+FLI="ID"|AT+FNR=1,1,1,1|at+FAA=1;a!
    DTE rate problem
      The most of Class 2 fax modems switch DTE rate to 19.2 Kbps on
      detection of the first Phase B preamble, but some modems leave DTE rate
      unchanged. DTE rates of the mailer and the fax modem must be synchronised.
      This is gained by proper setting of "Switch DTE to 19.2 Kbps" option
      of "Fax" tab of "Modem configuration" dialogue box. Reception of debris
      after +FCON or +FCO means improper DTE switch mode setting.

[*] Items of "Dial-up Configuration", "Events Configurations" and atoms
    within "Edit Event" dialogue boxes can be edited by double-clicking on
    them. It makes the configuration process much easier :-)

[!] Argus supports DNS distributed nodelists.
    Intro.
      IP addresses of FTN nodes can be from DNS by rendering their FTN
      addresses to host domain name and resolving this name. The rendering
      is performing by the following scheme:
      [p<Point>.]f<Node>.n<Net>.z<Zone>.<RootDomain>
      The default root domain for Fidonet-reserved FTN-zones (1,2,3,4,5,6) is
      fidonet.net. E.g., the IP address of node 1:2/3.4, according to this
      scheme, is to be the same as of host p4.f2.n3.z1.fidonet.net.
    Configuring
      Root domains for each address mask are configured in DNS tab of
      TCP/IP Daemon Configuration dialogue.
    Fidonet.net root domain
      Here is a FAQ on fidonet.net domain, dated 12-Nov-1997. The most recent
      list is available at http://www.doe.carleton.ca/~nsoveiko/fido/fido-over-ip.FAQ.english.html#fidonet.net
       Q? What is fidonet.net?
       A: fidonet.net is an Internet domain registered to facilitate
          development and deployment of fido-over-internet technology of all
          kinds and flavours.
       Q? How fidonet.net sub-domain and host names are assigned?
       A: Sub-domain and host names are formed in the same way as for the
          fidonet.org domain. For example, if your 4D Fidonet address is
          A:BBB/CCC[.DDD], then your domain address would be
          [pDDD.]fCCC.nBBB.zA.fidonet.net. Such unique address mapping allows
          one to obtain a node's IP address knowing only it's FTN address.
          Binkd is supporting such address mapping directly starting from
          version 0.9.2.
       Q? What is the difference between fidonet.net and fidonet.org than?
       A: Fidonet.org domain was registered with the purpose of exchanging
          mail between Internet RFC822-style and Fidonet mail systems. In
          other words, hosts in the fidonet.org domains are Fidonet-Internet
          gateways that are supposed to accept mail by both SMTP and FTS-1
          (or, better EMSI) protocols. There is no such restriction on hosts
          in fidonet.net domains. Technology developed and tested
          in fidonet.net domain in the future might migrate to the fidonet.org
          domain subject to approval of the latter's administration.
       Q? What do I do to get a fidonet.net host name?
       A: Your system should have binkp capability. This protocol is currently
          supported by binkd and Argus mailers. You should contact a person
          who is responsible for DNS in your Fidonet network. You can use
          nslookup to figure out if your network already has a DNS server. If
          there is none, please contact Fyodor Ustinov, 2:5020/79,
          ufm@prospect.com.ru to arrange a DNS record for you.
       Q? I am using Vmodem. Why should I install something else in order to
          be listed in fidonet.net?
       A: Common sense is that Fidonet systems should be able to exchange mail
          directly. In order to make this possible, they should support some
          protocol which will be the least common denominator for a given
          transport. FTS-1 is such a protocol for conventional dial-up
          transport. Vmodem-based technologies do not make a good candidate
          for the least common denominator protocol because for many platforms
          these technologies are not free they merely adapt dial-up technology
          for TCP/IP transport retaining many drawbacks of the former and
          without taking full advantage of the latter. On the contrary, binkp
          is an open specification protocol designed to operate over reliable
          connections with unpredictable delays (such as TCP connections) has
          a portable implementation that is distributed in sources under terms
          of GNU public license. So, it seems to be a natural choice for the
          least common denominator protocol.

[+] NT-version has a thread-monitoring facility via threads statistics of
    threads.txt file, located in default log directory.

[*] Improved performance of Niagara session over the high-speed lines with
    large delay.

[*] Primary address of a password-protected session is now considered not a
    first address of AKA list but the first password-protected address.
    There can be several addresses protected with one password though.
    Primary address is used to link requested files to, also during SRIF
    requests, and to be mentioned in binary_log. Address filtering mechanism
    of Post-processors is also based on primary address.

[+] It's now possible to dispatch incoming mail to several inbound
    directories according to file mask and remote's primary address.
    You can also specify a list of addresses and/or file masks in a single
    fields. The items of a list are combined with logical OR operation.
    Launching external application after a sessions with defined links
    is also possible.
     '&' character, preceding the string of "String to execute" field
     of Config/Externals/Post-processors is used to define that the files
     with conditions matched in "Mask list" field must be placed in the
     inbound directory defined (after the '&' character).

     This is an example of moving files, received from 59's points, to
     INPNT directory.

     Mask list         String to execute

     2:469/59.*        &INPNT

[-] Fixed some minor bugs with launching external applications.

[-] Some fixes with EMSI handshaking.

[-] Nodelist compilation window, invoked by nodelist.ok file flag had not
    been closed automatically.

[-] Fixed "Lamps Fader" thread's behaviour. This fix can reduce the thread's
    CPU consumption by 100 times and more (for WinNT - see threads.txt).

[-] Some fixes related to the Year 2000 Problem.


3.122 (21-Oct-1997)
-------------------

[!] Argus receives mail and files on incoming FTS-0001 session. FSC-0039 and
    FSC-0045 packet types are also supporting to extract remote information.
    There are some restrictions:
    - Outgoing FTS-0001 calls are not supported.
    - Argus receives only and does not send out files during FTS-0001 session.
    - The password length is limited by FTS-0001 to 8 characters. Links with
      more than 8 characters in a password would be unable to initiate a
      password-protected FTS-0001 session.
    - Skip File and Reject File operations are disabled (as well as
      refuse/delay).
    - No file regets.
    - Some FTS-0001 mailers do not provide valid file time.

[*] "Carrier is still high" message is now checking no more than three times,
    than the line goes to Error state.

[*] DCD signal is now virtual. CONNECT message is enough.

[*] Some fixes around +FCO.

[-] Fixed a bug with "Dialling" & "Not enough rings to answer"
    (Nicolas Rodionov).

[*] Zone root entry is now not necessary for nodelist browsing.

[-] Fixed some grammatical mistakes (Nicolas Rodionov).

[-] Some fixes with WinSocket initialisation/finalisation.

[-] Some minor bug-fixes.


3.118 (9-Oct-1997)
------------------

[-] ?lo-files, rendered to pkt by Outbound Manager, were not deleted after
    the transmission (Pavel Levshin).

[-] Outbound SmartMenu(tm)'s Kill item changed to Finalize. It kills the only
    "kill-sent" files and truncates "truncate-sent".

[*] EMSI sequences TCP/PCT replaced to TZP/PZT.

[-] New Item of SmartMenu(tm) - Open (also called by pressing Enter or by
    click mouse twice). Opens a file with an external viewing application,
    associated with the file type in the registry (Vladimir Dobrachev).


3.114 (3-Oct-1997)
------------------

[*] Mirror & Close Window items moved to System Menu. Window menu has
    been removed.

[*] File Requests, Externals, Events, Periodical Polls and Poll Options
    items moved to Config menu. Advanced many has been removed.

[-] Events on TCP/Daemon. Pervious version ignored events linked to TCP/IP
    Daemon.

[*] Row selection in list boxes. It is now possible to select any point of
    row to activate the cursor.

[+] Duplicate Row item in String Grid's pop-up menu.

[-] It was unable to Export/Import a String Grid containing '|' character.

[*] Extended restrictions. Items within a row are combined with logical AND
    operation, rows within a grid are combined with logical OR operation.

[!] Config/External Polls. External polls allow to execute an external
    application instead of polling nodes, specified in Address list field of
    the dialogue. Application string format is the same as in Config/Externals/
    Doors or Config/Dial-up/Modems/External Fax Receiver, ie all Handshake
    Switches are applied and new introduced (as well as environment variables):
      %w ARGUS_NODE     External poll's node address, eg "2:469/38"
      %x ARGUS_STATION  Station name from nodelist, if applies
      %v ARGUS_LOCATION Site location from nodelist, if applies
      %X ARGUS_SYSOP    Sysop's name from nodelist, if applies
      %y ARGUS_PHONE    Phone number or IP address from nodelist or overrides
      %Y ARGUS_FLAGS    Node flags from nodelist or overrides
      %W ARGUS_SPEED    Node speed from nodelist, if applies
    Options' format is:
     OkRange BusyRange NoCRange FailRange TimeoutMinutes TimeoutExitCode
    It is possible to use enumerations and intervals in Ranges, (like as in
    cron). eg "1,3,9-15". They also can be skipped by "." (point) character.
    If none of values matches, the poll is considered to be completed OK.
    Eg, options field "0 1 2,5-7 3,4 10 8" means that an external poll is OK
    when the application returns exit code 0, busy on exit code=1, no connect
    on 2,5,6,7 and fail on 3,4. "10" means than the application would be
    terminated after 10 minutes of its execution, if it would not exit by
    itself. If the application was terminated by time-out, its exit code is
    set to TimeoutExitCode, ie 8 in the example above. The default value of
    TimeoutExitCode (if missed) is 1. If TimeoutMinutes value missed,
    the application would only exit by itself (if it would).

[+] BinkP over Dial-up. This version introduces Niagara(tm) algorithm as
    a Transport Layer for using Dima Maloff's BinkP protocol over dial-up
    connection. The major benefits of Niagara are advanced selective-reject
    error connection and echo-protection.

[!] Encrypted BinkP-session. This version introduces an optional encryption
    layer between Transport Layer (TCP or Niagara) and Protocol Layer (BinkP).
    Note that encryption sessions require CPU overhead. This version contains
    cryptographic software (DES ECB encryption routines) written by Eric Young
    (eay@mincom.oz.au). This version also contains RSA Data Security, Inc. MD5
    Message-Digest Algorithm.

[+] Config/Encrypted Links. This dialogue allows to specify the nodes that
    are allowed to connect using encrypted session only. You must also
    specify the password for the link, which is after the input rendered
    to DES session key and stored to config.bin. We recommend to use Master
    Password as one of solutions to prevent encrypted links' keys from being
    stolen with config.bin. If you would forget the link's password, there
    would be no way to retreive it.

[+] Master Password. It is purposed to encrypt "config.bin" file using DES
    and MD5 algorithms to prevent your Argus configuration data (especially
    encrypted links' keys) from being stolen. Once set, Master Password would
    be asked each time Argus starts up, and before changing encrypted links'
    keys. If you would forget your Master password, there would be no
    easy practical way to retrieve the configuration data. Please use it
    very carefully. We also recommend to back up the original config.bin
    to a safe place.

[-] Fixed File Refuse (destructive skip) on ZModem. There still is a problem
    with File Skip (non-destructive skip) because of ZFERR command
    mishandling by some mailers.

[+] Tool/Attach files. It is also possible to attach multiple files at once
    by using Ctrl and Shift keys in File Dialogue box. Argus provides all
    registered file types as filters of the dialogue.

[+] Files can also be attached by pulling them from Windows Explorer and
    dropping to outbound manager area.

[*] Outbound flags (empty ?lo-files) are used to define .req's status and
    as a signals to initiate a crash/direct outbound poll.

[!] Outbound SmartMenu(tm) is a special pop-up menu, called by clicking right
    mouse button or Space key on outbound node, smartly provides all possible
    operations with that node.
     * Attach to current node - invokes file attachment procedure, similar to
       Tool/Attach files main menu item.
     * Poll to current node - invokes node polling procedure, similar to
       Poll/Create main menu item.
     * Edit file request to current node - invokes file requesting procedure,
       similar to Tool/Edit File Request main menu item.
     * Browse Nodelist at current node - invokes nodelist browsing procedure,
       similar to Tool/Browse nodelist
    The following operations are performed on "current items":
         - Currently selected outbound file (current item of current node)
         - All of same file name of current node, ie filename.*, when
           filename.ext is currently selected outbound file.
         - All of same file extension of current node, ie *.ext, when
           filename.ext is currently selected outbound file.
         - All of same attach status of current node.
         - All Entries of Current Node.
         - Entire outbound, ie all items within Argus outbound.
     * Readdress - allows current items to be re-addressed to another node.
       Attachment status remains unchanged.
     * Kill - kills current items. Dangerous! :-)
     * Change flavour to Crash/Direct/Normal/Hold - changes the attachment
       status of current items.
     * Unlink - unlinks (de-attaches) current items without killing them.
     * Remove broken links - unlinks (de-attaches) files, which are not
       available within current items. Be careful - links can be temporarily
       broken due to lost connection to network outbound or other temporary
       accessing errors.

[+] Argus now sends appropriate messages before disconnecting socket if the
    limit of simultaneous incoming TCP/IP connection has exceeded.
    M_BSY/"Too many servers are running" on BinkP and "BUSY"+CR on ifcico /
    Telnet.

[+] Overrides Editor for dial-up and TCP/IP nodes, with one target per line
    and human-readable online time (local), ie "11:00-23:00" instead of
    "U,TLXL". Note, that UTC FSC-0062 Txy flags are also converted to local
    time after editing the node overrides in Overrides Editor.

2.701 (16-Jul-1997)
-------------------

[+] '?' character before command/file name in
    "Advanced/Externals/Cron/String to Execute", or
    "Advanced/Externals/Post-processors/String to Execute" instructs
    to execute the process in DETACHED_MODE (without using console window) .
    This flag can be used only for launching Win32 console applications.
    An attempt to execute DETACHED Win3.1 or DOS application causes the error.
    Processes can be launched with the following priority levels:
     '<' - Low (IDLE_PRIORITY_CLASS)
     '+' - High (HIGH_PRIORITY_CLASS)
     '*' - Real-time (REALTIME_PRIORITY_CLASS).
    Processes are executing with normal priority (NORMAL_PRIORITY_CLASS)
    by default.

2.68 (28-Jun-1997)
------------------

[+] Flag TxyL (same as Txy, but works on local time instead of UTC).

[+] Import of node online time information during T-Mail configuration
    import. Complex constructions are also supported, eg.:
